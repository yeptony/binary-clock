A Binary Clock
==============
A minimal, yet extensive, binary clock built in Jquery, CSS and Bootstrap.

How does it work?

The binary clock comes with a calculation help and a classic decimal clock.

You can remove all elements by keyboard pushes and end up with a minimalistic binary clock.

Simply press _h_ which will show the following help message.

- Press _t_ to toggle the title.
- Press _b_ to toggle the binary calculations.
- Press _c_ to toggle the decimal clock.

### CHEERS!
